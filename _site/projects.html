<ul>
  <li>Implemented Dolev’s Reliable Communication algorithm and its five modifications described in the paper: Bonomi, G. Farina, and S. Tixeuil, “Multi-hop byzantine reliable broadcast with honest dealer made practical,” Journal of the Brazilian Computer Society, vol. 25, pp. 1–23, 2019</li>
  <li>Implemented Bracha’s reliable broadcast algorithm on the top of the fully-connected network topology that Dolev algorithm provided.</li>
  <li>Implemented a casual-order Byzantine broadcast algorithm using vector clock technique. causal-order Byzantine broadcast</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2-extension-and-modification-of-xv6-operating-system">2. Extension and Modification of XV6 operating system</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Implemented Unix utilities in xv6, including sleep, find, xargs, gaining proficiency in system calls.</li>
  <li>Added trace and Sysinfo system call</li>
  <li>Optimized system calls and detected accessed pages.</li>
  <li>Implemented Copy-on-Write Fork in xv6.</li>
  <li>Developed an xv6 device driver for a network interface card (NIC).</li>
  <li>Redesigned code to increase parallelism, addressing high lock contention in xv6 memory allocator.</li>
  <li>Enhanced xv6 file system by adding support for large files and symbolic links.</li>
  <li>Implemented mmap and munmap system calls in xv6.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="3-advanced-computing-systems-labs">3. Advanced Computing Systems Labs</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Conducted profiling with gprof to identify bottlenecks; optimized matrix multiplication using SIMD (AVX) and multi-core parallelism (OpenMP), employing techniques including fine-tuning OMP directives and reordering multiplication to leverage cache locality.</li>
  <li>Analyzed CPU and CUDA implementations, identified bottlenecks through Nsight system profiling, and optimized by improving data transfer efficiency, leveraging shared memory, and fine-tuning grid and block dimensions.</li>
  <li>Accelerated the K Means algorithm using CUDA, implementing optimization strategies identified through profiling, including fine-tuning grid and block dimensions, and leveraging shared memory to reduce the data transfer overhead.</li>

<h4 id="4-multi-threaded-regular-expression-search-in-rust-grep">4. Multi-threaded	Regular	Expression	Search	in	Rust (grep)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Approach 1 - Rayon Implementation: Developed a multi-threaded	regular	expression search tool in Rust.	Used clap for command-line
 argument parsing, regex for pattern matching, and rayon for parallel processing. Ensured data consistency and thread safety in a multi
threaded environment using Mutex and Arc.</li>
  <li>Approach	2	-	Thread	Pool	Implementation:	Developed	another	multi-threaded	regular	expression	search	tool	in	Rust.	Used	clap	for
 command-line	argument	parsing,	regex	for	pattern	matching,	and	implemented	parallel	processing	using	a	custom	thread	pool.	The	custom
 thread	pool	employed	mpsc	for	task	scheduling	and	Mutex	and	Arc	for	thread	safety	and	data	consistency.	Conducted	performance	testing
 on	a	Linux	system	using	the	time	command.	The	custom	thread	pool	approach	achieved	a	39.1%	performance	improvement	over	GNU
 grep	when	executing	<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grep [mM]icrodevice	..</code></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="5-analysis-of-an-efficient-classification-method-based-on-density-optimization">5. Analysis of an efficient classification method based on density optimization</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Investigated and optimized the classifier using a DPC-based data preprocessing method to address the problem of multi-classification unbalanced data.</li>
  <li>Analyzed three mainstream classifiers: random forest, decision tree, k-nearest neighbor, and support vector machine, with a focus on using the weighted KNN algorithm based on kernel function for prediction training.</li>
  <li>Utilized the DPC algorithm to select the cluster center and determine the optimal clipping threshold through experimentation, resulting in an optimized training set for the classifier.</li>
  <li>Employed a cross test to test the accuracy of the model, and experimental results showed a well improvement in classifier accuracy using the optimization algorithm in most of cases.</li>
</ul>

## About Me


<img class="profile-picture" src="personal photo.jpg">

Hi! I am Zhuoran Wang, a master student in Shool of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science at Delft University of Technology, majoring in Computer Engineering (now Computer and Embedded Systems Engineering).




## Research Interests

<!-- I see myself as a [systems researcher](https://www.usenix.org/publications/login-logout/november-2013-login-logout/night-watch) with a focus on the intersection of system design and machine learning (ML).  -->

My primary interest lies in AI and ML systems. Grounded in systems research, my work often extends to the algorithmic and application layers, aiming to 
connect low-level optimization with higher-level design. 
I am passionate about building, debugging, and improving complex systems, with a particular emphasis on enhancing the efficiency of large language model (LLM) inference and distributed training. 
Central to my approach is a firm belief in the power of hardware-software-algorithm co-design. I am convinced that only by tightly integrating algorithm, software and hardware development can we achieve the level of efficiency and scalability necessary to democratize the use of LLMs, making them more accessible and effective for a wide range of applications.
